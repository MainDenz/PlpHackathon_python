## 1. Fibonacci Sequence

- Asks user to input the value of `n`.
- Creates a function that takes n as a `parameter` and `returns` a list containing the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Then it prints the `generated` Fibonacci sequence.

## 2. Python Conditional Statement

- Prompts a user to enter their `age`.
- Uses a conditional statement to check if the `age` is `greater than` or `equal to` 18.
- Prints `You are eligible to vote` if true, otherwise `You are not eligible to vote`
